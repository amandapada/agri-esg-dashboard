# 🌱 AgriESG — AI-Driven ESG Scoring for Farmers & Agribusinesses

AgriESG is a sustainability intelligence platform that enables farmers, cooperatives, and agribusiness organisations to measure, understand, and improve their Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) performance.

Our mission is to make **ESG reporting simple, accessible, and actionable for agriculture**, supporting farms in unlocking premium markets, meeting environmental standards, and improving climate resilience.

This repository contains the two core Streamlit applications powering the AgriESG MVP.

## 🚜 1. Multi-Farm ESG Dashboard (`agri_esg_dashboard.py`)

This application provides a **portfolio-level ESG overview** for organisations managing multiple farms. Users upload a CSV dataset, and the system automatically generates:

### Key Features

* Total emissions (CO₂e) across farms
* Yield & land productivity indicators
* Nitrogen, diesel, and electricity footprint
* Water use & irrigation intensity
* Worker demographics (female share, total workers)
* Health & safety metrics (accidents per 100 workers)
* Dynamic charts and KPI cards
* Automatic data validation and error handling

**Ideal For:**
Cooperatives, agribusiness managers, extension services, ESG consultants, buyers.

## 🧑‍🌾 2. Farm-Level ESG Analysis Tool (`farm_esg_analysis.py`)

This tool provides a **deep-dive ESG report for a single farm**, showing performance across environmental, social and governance pillars.

### Key Features

* Emissions per tonne & per hectare
* Soil health scoring (organic matter, pH)
* Regenerative practice scoring (rotation, cover cropping, manure use, irrigation type)
* Water productivity (m³ per tonne)
* Social indicators (gender inclusion, training, accidents)
* Governance indicators (policies, training, certification)
* Automatic insight generator explaining strengths & risks
* Visual charts for emissions and efficiency

**Ideal For:**
Individual farmers, regenerative agriculture programmes, crop & dairy producers, certification consultants.

## 📊 Data Format Requirements

To ensure the analysis works correctly, the CSV uploads must contain the following minimum fields:

### Required Columns for Multi-Farm Dashboard:

```
organisation_name
farm_id
country
year
crop
area_ha
yield_tonnes
fertilizer_n_kg
diesel_litres
electricity_kwh
water_m3
workers_total
workers_female
accidents_count
```

### Required Columns for Farm-Level ESG Analysis:

```
farm_id
farm_name
country
year
crop_type
land_area_ha
total_yield_tonnes
nitrogen_kg
diesel_litres
electricity_kwh
irrigation_water_m3
workers_total
workers_female
accidents_count
```

### Optional Columns

Adding these columns produces deeper ESG insights:

```
phosphate_kg, potash_kg, organic_manure_kg
pesticide_liters, herbicide_liters, fungicide_liters
soil_organic_matter_pct, soil_ph
crop_rotation, cover_cropping
training_hours, living_wage_paid
